Circle Land Films was started in early 2016 by the Kay-King
Family.
<br/><br/>
Based in Westerleigh (Bristol, UK) we make strictly non-commercial films,
just for fun.
<br/><br/>
Our aim is to tell stories and learn about all aspects of filmmaking
in an inclusive, respectful and (hopefully) relaxed way.
<br/><br/>
We are always looking for volunteers – we could always use
actors, camera operators, sound engineers, post production
people, VFX people, scriptwriters, etc.
<br/><br/>
We are no experts, but if you are new to filmmaking or just wanted
to come along to a shoot, we would be happy to show you what we
know. We don’t have any restrictions, our first two films were
based on ideas suggested by a four year old!
<br/><br/>
