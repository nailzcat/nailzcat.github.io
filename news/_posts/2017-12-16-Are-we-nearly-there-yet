 Usually if I say to people “I’m making a film, anyone can help, would you like to join in?” the response I get (apart from “No”) is...

 “Oh yeah? I’ve always fancied having a go at acting”. 

 I should make it clear that the last thing I want to do is say anything bad about the actors in our film. They were all amazing, multi-talented, highly skilled and most importantly - completely unpaid. They helped with camerawork, lighting, stunts and  scriptwriting. They provided costumes, entertained children off camera, put up with being shouted at, and so many other things.

 All I want to say was that even if you are not interested in acting, there are so many other ways and opportunities to get involved in making a film.

  It has taken almost 9 months of (part time) effort to make our 13 minute film. That time can be broken down like this:

*Music/Foley - the time spent on these was time it took me to find some music I liked and obtain permission to use it, and in the case of the intro guitar piece to commission something especially for the film. I cannot imagine how many months and years of effort has gone into the creations of the talented artists who actually made the music! Huge thanks to them.

 So the point of all this was just to say that if anyone would like to help make a film for fun, there is a huge amount of stuff you can help with behind the camera**. We would be very grateful to anyone that wanted to volunteer some time on our next project (more details on that soon). 

** If you are around though, I cannot promise that you will not end up in front of the camera at some point too :)
