 “Oh yeah? I’ve always fancied having a go at acting”.
<br/>
<br/>
I should make it clear that the last thing I want to do is say anything bad about the actors in our film. They were all amazing, multi-talented, highly skilled and most importantly - completely unpaid. They helped with camerawork, lighting, stunts and  scriptwriting. They provided costumes, entertained children off camera, put up with being shouted at, and so many other things.
<br/>
<br/>
 All I want to say was that even if you are not interested in acting, there are so many other ways and opportunities to get involved in making a film.
<br/>
<br/>
  It has taken almost 9 months of (part time) effort to make our 13 minute film. That time can be broken down like this:

_*Music/Foley - the time spent on these was time it took me to find some music I liked and obtain permission to use it, and in the case of the intro guitar piece to commission something especially for the film. I cannot imagine how many months and years of effort has gone into the creations of the talented artists who actually made the music! Huge thanks to them._
<br/>
<br/>
 So the point of all this was just to say that if anyone would like to help make a film for fun, there is a huge amount of stuff you can help with behind the camera**. We would be very grateful to anyone that wanted to volunteer some time on our next project (more details on that soon). 
<br/>
<br/>
** If you are around though, I cannot promise that you will not end up in front of the camera at some point too :)
