I dunno if spaffing loads of bullets everywhere is necessarily a bad tactic, in the game or real life? I like to shoot through doorways sometimes to create the illusion that there are loads of people outside. I like to wildly spray a whole clip while hiding to give the impression that I am some trigger happy noob. Sometimes I fire just to create noise, or as a mini-map diversion.
